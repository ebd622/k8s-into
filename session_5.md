## Why do we need Helm
In Kubernetes we describe everything what we do with yaml-files. These yaml-fails represent objects such as deployments, pods, services and so on. The objects are represented in **declarative** way. It means we tell Kubernetes exactly what we need and Kubernetes makes it happen. 

But managing all yaml-files can sometimes become a bit complicated. We may have many different yaml-files needed to deploy our applications/services to a Kubernetes cluster. All these yaml-s makes up our application and its infrastructure. 

It is important to notice here that all the yaml-s are not **reusable**. It means that if we want to build another application - we will have to copy/paste all the yaml-s and then change what is needed. If we need to deploy more applications we may end up with lots of yaml-s and lots of duplication. 

In over time these yaml-s may become hard to manage. And this is where Helm comes in.

## What is Helm
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It is maintained by the [CNCF](https://cncf.io/) - in collaboration with  Microsoft,  Google,  [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/) and the Helm contributor community. We can think of Helm as *apt*, *yum* or *Homebrew* for Kubernetes.

Helm allows up to bring all yaml-files together and in what's called a ***Chart***. A chart can have a *name*, a *description* and a *version*. 

A chart groups all yaml-s together in a folder called ***templates***. To make this chart reusable we have the ability to inject values as parameters. We can deploy a chart and inject a name which we can use in our deployment, for example APP-1. We can reuse this chart and deploy it into the same Kubernetes cluster or somewhere else with another name - APP-2. 

Once we have this chart we can effectively reuse all yaml-s by injecting parameters into it. This gives us greater flexibility as we can reuse the chart among many applications and micro-services. 

*Injecting parameters in a chart makes our chart **generic***.


## Arcitecture

First we have to distinguish Helm 2 and Helm 3. 

#### Helm 2
In  the version 2 Helm installation comes in two parts: a ***Helm Client*** (CLI) and a server called ***Tiller***:

This architecture offers additional valuable feature which is **Release Management**. 

*Release Management*<br/>
Whenever you create or change deployment Tiller will store a copy of each configuration for future reference. In this way Tiller creates a history and keeps track of all chart executions. This allows to rollback to a previous revision in a case of any issue with a new deployment.

But Helm 2 architecture has a big caveat because Tiller has too much power inside of a Kubernetes cluster:
* Tiller can create, updated, delete components;
* Tiller has too much permissions within a cluster. 

This makes a big security issue. This is a reason why Tiller has been removed in Helm 3.


#### Helm 3
Helm 3 uses the client-only architecture:

Removing Tiller has solved a security concern making Helm more secure. But this also makes *Release Management* feature more challenging.
