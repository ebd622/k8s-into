### Container Orchectration
Container orchestration is all about managing the lifecycles of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments.

Basic questions to be addressed:
* What if your application relies on other containers such as database or messaging services or
other backend services?
* What if the number of users increase and you need to scale your application? You would also like to scale down when the load decreases

To enable these functionalities you need an underlying platform with a set of resources. The platform needs to orchestrate the connectivity between the
containers and automatically scale up or down based on the load. This whole process of automatically deploying and managing containers is known as **Container Orchestration**.

### Kubernetes Architecture
